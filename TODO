- Anything in the list at the bottom of README.md
- More tests for while (check side effects and break)
- Implement 'let'
- Fix report and number lines: number lines are not being used consistently over the code
- Reduce to the minimum the amount of native code in functions and macros
    - Divide the functions and macros in "essential" and "performance"
    - Provide implementations in Lisp of "performance" macros and functions
    - Leave the "performance" functions and macros in a file which can optionally be loaded
